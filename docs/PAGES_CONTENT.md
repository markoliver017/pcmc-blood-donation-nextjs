3. Why Donate
   🩸 Why Donate Blood?
   Because Every Drop Counts—Especially for Children
   **\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***
   ❤️ 1. Save Lives—Especially Young Ones
   • Every single blood donation can save up to three lives. Many of them are children facing necessary surgical procedures, cancer, anemia, trauma, and other life-threatening conditions.
   • Pediatric patients often require smaller, more frequent transfusions, meaning more donors are needed to meet their unique needs.
   **\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***
   👶 2. Children Can’t Donate—But You Can
   • Kids fighting for their lives depend on healthy adult volunteers.
   • Whether it's a newborn in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or a child undergoing chemotherapy, your donation may be their only chance.
   • Some of our patients depend on lifelong, regular transfusions to survive, for example, patients with Thalassemia.  
    **\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***
   🕒 3. It Will Only Take 30 Minutes of Your Time
   • From arrival to recovery, donating blood is quick, safe, and easy—and it makes a lifelong impact.
   • Use the mobile portal to donate at your convenience, close to home or work.
   **\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***
   🌍 4. Join a Life-Saving Community
   • Be part of a caring network of volunteers helping children in your community.
   • Track your donations, earn milestones, and see the real-world impact of your contribution.
   **\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***
   💪 5. It’s Good for Your Health Too
   • Regular blood donation can:
   o Stimulate red blood cell production
   o Provide a mini health check (Blood pressure check, hemoglobin determination, etc.)
   o Encourage a sense of purpose and emotional well-being
   **\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***
   “You may not know the child whose life you save—but they’ll never forget your gift.”
